			<p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling,
			among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. 
			Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.</p>
